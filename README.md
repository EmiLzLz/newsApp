# About

I made the app with a SPA structure. I used a router file, 
to divide the news by sections and show the corresponding html content.

There are 5 news sections in the app. 

Each news item has an author, date, and an image.

# Technologies

* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

## I used the Inshorts News API from [public-apis](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#news)
